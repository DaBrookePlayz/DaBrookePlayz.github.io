			<h1>Choices</h1>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You have experienced ten unique conclusions of how your choices have affected your life and other's. This game is unfortunately confined to few choices due to technical and time restrictions, but life is full of choices. Each of us makes tens of thousands of decisions every day, which most can change your future in some way or another, regardless of how important you may think it is at that moment. You have the glorious power to make these decisions, and the capability to influence your enviroment and the people around you.
			<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We may sway our choices based on biases, experiences, morals, or emotions, and these can create decisions that could be considered bad or good, selfish or kind, harmful or beneficial. One must remember though that others exist too, with their own biases, experiences, morals, and emotions that influence their own decisions, some of those may be from the decisions you made. We are all humans with our own souls and lives, and it's important to realize this when making a decision so we can correctly assess what is at stake.
			<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There was a golden rule that my school had when I was in elementary school: treat others the way you want to be treated. This is vital to follow, as the decisions you make now may affect how people see and think about you later in life. This rule has its exceptions though, as it has led some to believe that good behavior will always give you good rewards instantly. You shouldn’t expect to get a reward or get noticed for your actions, just being nice is a good thing.
			<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The truth is that most people do not follow this golden rule or correctly assess their situation, and rely on selfishness to decide, using others and our fragile environment to their own benefit. Today, our world is faced with many crisises, including climate change, discrimination, slavery, poverty, nuclear war, and many other horrible things that people don't deserve to suffer through, but our choices made them exist, but our choices now can also fix them, until it's too late.
			<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For my high school Senior Experience project, I didn’t want to just create a game focused on the basics of animation. I didn't want to do something simple or easy. I wanted to create something that people could learn from and remember. What I want you to learn is that no matter who you are, you make choices every day that influence yours and other’s futures. If you are kind to people, they will be kind back. You have the power to make real change. You have the ability to make the world a better place, but if that seems impossible, then start small. Open the door for someone. Clean up litter you see nearby. Vote for laws that help the unfortunate.
			<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Be the light that people need nowadays.</p>
