			<h2>A Thing To Note</h2>
			<p>For the vast majority of computer users, you DO NOT need to build your own PC. If you do not feel comfortable dealing with computer parts, then just buy a pre-built computer, or even a laptop. While pre-built towers tend to be more expensive than just building it on your own, one can easily break components or get electrocuted by improperly building a PC. Custom-built PCs are also typically meant for those who need a very high performance computer with expensive parts.<br></p>
