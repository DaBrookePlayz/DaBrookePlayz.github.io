# DaBrookePlayz.github.io
Temporary(?) repo for Cydia. I was going to submit my theme to Packix but I get denied :(.

# Leisu 1.0.0
Honestly, I have no idea what I'm doing right now. Never used GitHub before, but I hope that I can learn more about it later.
Anyways, this is a theme that tries to stay as close to stock as possible, but they all have been converted into glyphs, so they can fit together nicely. I hope to update this from about a week to every other week. It depends on how many icon requests I get.
